# Simplified-photogrammetry

Script code 'Mapping_procedure.m', where we implement the simplified photogrammetry procedure mapping procedure steps in a MATLAB environment with 2D images (in folder 'bump72_Mp5_adjusted') taken in the Mach number 0.5 experiment over bump geometry.
 	
The script plots the following figures that are shown in the manuscript: Figs. 3a,3b,3c; Fig. 4; Figs. 5a,5b,5c; Fig. 6a, 6b, 6c; Figs. 7a,7b,7c,7d, 7e. 
 	
The default settings of the script are: flag_save=0; flag_Gifsave=0; imval=3. For quake run for the entire script, just press Run.
 	
By setting flag_save=1; flag_Gifsave=1; the script will create folder to save the figures and created GIF file.
 	
By setting imval=1,2 or 3, the user can project the images 1,2,3 shown in Fig 3a of the manuscript.
  	
To run the script, make sure that the folder 'bump72_Mp5_adjusted' at the same folder as the script file 'Mapping_procedure.m'
